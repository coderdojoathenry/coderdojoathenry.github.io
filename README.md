# Coderdojo Athenry Showcase

Athenry Coderdojo is one of Ireland's premier computer clubs for kids and meets every Saturday in Athenry at 12pm.  

This page is mainly for demo projects - for full details and tutorials, check out [our website](http://coderdojoathenry.com)!!

## Explorers
The _Explorers_ group, led by Martha, is where people usually start; they learn how to progam in Scratch and how to use graphics packages and stop-motion animation.  

## Advancers
The _Advancers_ group, led by Oliver is for ninjas who have done a few years of Explorers and want to progress to more advanced coding concepts, still mainly using the Scratch programming environment, but also using other tools.  

## Creators
The _Creators_ group, led by Kieran and Mark focuses on creative coding in various languages and platforms - largely in Javascript.  Creative coding is the use of code for the generation of artistic endeavours. This group is a great foundation in text-based coding which will serve the ninjas for life!  Because Creators use javascript, we can use this website as a showcase for our projects - check them out here:

## Bodgers 
The _Bodgers_ group, led by Declan, involves digital making and physical computing using the Raspberry Pi and Arduino.  They also specialize in defending the dojo against zombie attacks.

## Hackers
The _Hackers_, led by Kevin and Michael, is a hacker space for CoderDojo Athenry, with more in-depth projects building on technologies learned in other groups, and involves 3D modelling, 3D printing, and soldering.
